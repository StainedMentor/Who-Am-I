# LlamaGenerator
This class is used as a wrapper for **llama-cpp-python**. 
The main purpose of this class is to have a separate class for modifing model parameters.
This could also be used to connect to different models/apis by creating new classes with a `create_response_stream` function.


## Llama_cpp reference
The api reference for **llama-cpp-python** can be found under this [link.](https://llama-cpp-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/)
